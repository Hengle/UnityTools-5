# Unity Tools
A collection of useful tools for Unity.


### HCM (Hierarchy Color Manager)
Assign colors to the gameobjects in your hierarchy window. This is based on tags.

**Download** :
- [HierarchyColorManager.unitypackage.zip](https://github.com/dyfer08/UnityTools/raw/master/Unity%20Tools/Assets/Unity%20Packages/HierarchyColorManager.unitypackage.zip)

**Future improvements** :
- Maybe remove the total number of colors. Seems sadly useless :p

### BVAU (Bundle Version Auto Updater) for iOS & Android
Auto increment the bundle version number after a build on iOS and Android. This prevent your app from being rejected by the store submission if the bundle version has not changed.

**Download** :
- [BundleVersionAutoUpdater.unitypackage.zip](https://github.com/dyfer08/UnityTools/raw/master/Unity%20Tools/Assets/Unity%20Packages/BundleVersionAutoUpdater.unitypackage.zip)

**Future improvements** :
- Maybe add support for more platforms if required.

### Device Console
Receive and show every Unity console message directly in your build. this is especially useful on mobile and AR projects.

**Download** :
- [DeviceConsole.unitypackage.zip](https://github.com/dyfer08/UnityTools/raw/master/Unity%20Tools/Assets/Unity%20Packages/DeviceConsole.unitypackage.zip)

**How to use** :
- Just drag and drop the DeviceConsole prefab in your scene. If you need to adjust the scale, modify the Scale Factor of the Canvas Scaler component.

**Future improvements** :
- Maybe limit the console messages to 2 lines and show the full reslut in a bottom window when selected (like Unity does in the Editor).
